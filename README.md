# AICTE-And-VOIS-For-Tech-Program-Led-Virtual-Internship
*Data Analytics and Power Bi*.

*Summary*:- 
I honed my data analysis and visualization skills through a virtual internship program.  I tackled two projects, one focusing on retail sales insights and another analyzing crop production data.

*Projects:-
1) Retail Revelations: Navigating Superstore Insights (Python, Jupyter Notebook):
Leveraged Python libraries (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn) to analyze a retail superstore's sales data.
Uncovered trends and growth opportunities by examining regional performance, product categories, customer segmentation, and shipping methods.
Created insightful visualizations like bar graphs, pie charts, and line graphs to effectively communicate my findings.

2) Crop Performance Analysis (Power BI):
Utilized Power BI to analyze crop production data across various regions.
Identified patterns, disparities, and areas for improvement in agricultural practices by examining crop yield, cultivated area, and production levels.
Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard featuring pie charts, stacked bar charts, and donut charts for data visualization.

*Skills Developed*

Data analysis and visualization.
Proficiency in Python libraries (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn).
Experience with Power BI for data exploration and presentation.
This internship experience solidified my ability to extract valuable insights from data and present them in a clear and compelling manner.
